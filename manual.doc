# Manual  of Py_CpH-MD

Py_dCpH-MD: An open source python framework for discrete constant-pH molecular dynamics
========
Py_dCpH-MD realizes the discrete scheme of the constant pH MD methodology [1]. The code plugs into GROMACS [2] MD package. 
The algorithm ensures that the charge of the simulation box is kept neutral during the simulation. 

Unpack the compressed file with the following command:
tar -zxvf d_CpH-MD.tar


Requirements
------------
Please make sure that you have installed in your computing system the following libraries:
 - Python 2.7, 
 - Numpy and Scipy

You can check  where is python or which python, with the following command:
 * python -c 'import numpy; numpy.test()'
 * python -c 'import scipy; scipy.test()'

Also open the source code of d_CpH-MD.py using your favorite editor (vim, emacs, notepad)
and set up corretly  the path to the directory where Gromacs is installed.

Installation
------------
Unpack the compressed file with the following command:
tar -zxvf d_CpH-MD.tar

Usage
-----
Look how easy it is to use:

./d_CpH-MD.py CpH_MD.inp >& CpH_MD.log &

Features
--------

- Be awesome
- Make things faster

* The code is implemented to work with GROMACS MD package, but it can easily be integrated to other MD engines.
